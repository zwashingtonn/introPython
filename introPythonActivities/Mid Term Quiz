# 1. Describe what a computer program is and what does it do. 
a computer program are instructions a computer can excute.


# 2. Describe what complexity and abstraction are, then provide an example
# of complexity in the real world and how we apply abstraction to that thing (your example must be original and cannot be an example
# used in our lecture slides ie car, grocery store, etc.). complexity is the measure of how many resources a program needs to execute while abstraction is the process of making complicated things more simple.
An example is an Apple Watch because it contains numerous sets of coding, but there are apps that with one click will open.
  
# 3. What is Syntax in Python and why is it important to write proper syntax?
Python syntax is a set of rules that has guidelines for how it should be written and understood.
A Python Syntax is the rule that tells how a Python code will be written and interpreted. 

# 4. What is a function, and why do we wrap our code inside of functions?
A function is a reusable block of code, that we can use multiple times, we use this because it will simplify the code that we have written.# 5. Name and describe the three (3) naming conventions for variables in python? Then provide three (3) name rules for Python

# 5. Name and describe the three (3) naming conventions for variables in Python. Then provide three (3) name rules for Python
# variables.  only can use letters a - z, Only can use numbers 0 - 9, case sensitive (must be cases)

# 6. What will be the output of the print functions when this code is run, explain why
name = 'Bill'
student = name
name = 'Walter'
student= 'Richard'

print(name)
print(student)
it will print Walter and Richard because it will read the code from top to bottom and the name and student is closer to the print(name) and print(student) it will print out Walter and Richard.
# 7. Describe the difference between each of the following assignment operators:
# = 
# ==
# !=
for = u can assign values to a variable like z = 9
for == it compares variables 
for !== it means not equal to and u can use that for an if and else code btw.
 
# 8. What type of data can be stored in a Python list?
A python list is Intergers float strings etc

# 9. Create a function that will take in a word provided by a user and then output that word back to the user but in reverse. 
def word():

        word1 = input('Put in the word that you would like to reverse.')

   print(word1[::-1])
word ()

# 10. Create three (3) seperate functions that will do addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively. 
# each of these functions should take two (2) arguments. When the user passes these arguments into the function, they will be
# calculated together and return the output in your terminal. 
def adding(x , z)
    print( x + z)
adding (10 , 4)


def subtracting(x,z)
      print(x - z)
subtracting (10 , 4)

def multiplying (x,z)
    print (x*z)
multiplying (10 , 4)
# 11. What is the difference between a function argument and a function parameter? 
A function argument is data/info.  a function parameter is a place holder for code.

# 12. You have been hired by a software company and your first assignment is to develop a password authenticator program. 
# the goal of your program is to check a user's password and make sure it meets the company's password requirements. 
# the company has provided you with the following requirements for the passcode program:
# a. the passcode must NOT contain any numbers
# b. the passcode must NOT contain any capital letters
# c. the passcode can NOT be any longer than five (5) characters
# d. the passcode can NOT shorter the three (3) characters
# e. the user should be able to enter their password and if it meets the requirements, should print a message saying that 
# their password was created successfully, and if it was not, should send back a message with one of the following issues. 

# 13. When you run your code and see typeError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve
# the issue? typeError happens when u put in a command but it could not be preformed, probably u put in in wrong

# 14. When you run your code and see indentError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve 
# the issue? If u have indentError it means u forgot to indent and u just have to fix it.

# 15. Create a while loop that check a user's password. If they enter the password correct, they will get a message saying 
# that the password was entered successfully. If they enter the password incorrectly, it will tell the user to try again. 
# The user should only have three (3) attempts to get the password correct. If they enter the password incorrect on the fourth 
# attempt, a message should appear telling them that have been locked out and need to talk to the administrator. 

# 16. Which item is at index 5
giftShopping=['xbox','sneakers','necklace','clothing','laptop','gift card']

gift card is because the index count starts are 0 so xbox would be 0 and then gift card would be 5
and another was to show this is if we write print(giftShopping[5])

# 17. Create a for loop that will print ONLY the even numbers within the range of the variable provided below.
# HINT: You will need to use the range() function. 
upToNumber = 30

things = range(2,31,2)
for thing in things:
    print(thing)

# 18. Create a function that uses a conditional statement that checks if a person qualifies for a raise on their salary. 
# The user should be able to enter their name, their salary (how much money they make in an entire year), and how long they have
# worked at the company. If the user has been working at the company longer than four (4) years, they will get a 15% raise. 
# Your program should be able to calculate what their salary is with the 15% increase. If the user qualifies, your program
# should return the a message congratulating the user by name, and telling them what their new salary is with the 15%
# increase (this must be the actual number). If they do not qualify inform the user that unfortunately they do not qualify. 
salery = 20.00
new_salery_raise = 1.15


def getting_raise():
    name1 = input('what is your name? ')
    how_long = int(input('how long have you been working at our company? '))

    if how_long > 3:
        print('congradulations'+ name1 +'you just got a new raise')
        print('your new raise is below')
        print(salery*new_salery_raise)

    else:
        print('sorry no raise for you')

getting_raise()


# 19. Create a function that checks which value is greater than the other. Your function should take two (2) integer parameters. 
# and should evaluate which number is larger. Your function should then print the largest number. 

# 20. Create a while loop function that will add gift items to a list. Your function should ask the user to enter an item name. 
# The item name should then be added to a list variable called gift_bag. Your gift bag should have a limit of six (6) items. 
# Once your gift bag hits its limit of six (6) items your program should print a message saying 
# that the gift bag is full and print the list of items in the gift bag.
