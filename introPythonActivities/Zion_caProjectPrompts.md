My program is about fashion and choosing outfits. The problem I am trying to solve is color coordination almost like making the outfits match.
Three things my program is gonna do is Choose outfits that look good on u. Give you an image of what u would look like in the outfits of choose and then my program will bring the cloths to you.
No there are no programs like that now but there was a concept of clueless.
The basic code I need to use is a function.
