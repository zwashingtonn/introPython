# 1. What is the difference between 
# a parameter and an argument in a python function
"A paramater is a data holder while an arguement is the data."

# 2. In your own words, describe what 
# a conditional statement (if/else) is
if is if it is correct u will get a certain text but if it is anything else(else) it will be incorrect.

# 3. write a simple conditional state using a comparision operator(greater than, less than, etc. )
 money = 262.22
costoflashes = 189

# 4. Write a conditional statement for food in the refridgerator.
# your conditional statement should be wrapped in a function that takes one (1)
# parameter. The data type for this parameter should be true or false. 
# your function should have a line of code that asks the user if there is food in the refridgerator.
# If there is food in the refridgerator, print time to cook. If there is 
# NOT food in the fridge, print time to shop. 
# When you call your function there should be an argument that accepts 
# a boolean.

# 5. Create a function that checks the inventory of cereal for a store. 
# your function should have a parameter that accepts an integer. In your function
# use a conditional statement to determine if you need to order more cereal.
# If there is more than 10 boxes, print "inventory full", else if there are less than 
# 10 boxes print "we need to order more cereal".
