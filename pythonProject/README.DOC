What inspired you (or your team) to develop this program?
 My passion for fashion is what inspired me to develop this program; I wanted to create a tool that would enable people to get ready in the morning more quickly. Another thing that inspired me to create this program was the movie Clueless. In the show, there was a closet where the main character chose her school outfit first thing in the morning. I was inspired to create something similar because there are times when we teens take too long to choose an outfit for dress-down days. By using this closet, we can choose our outfits more quickly. The last thing that inspired was my niece who loves fashion and loves to play dress up so i would also make a mini one for children also.
